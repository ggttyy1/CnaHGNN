# CnaHGNN: Co-Embedding of Nodes and Attributes With Hypergraph Neural Networks  

## üìñ Introduction
we propose **CnaHGNN** ‚Äî a **node‚Äìattribute co-embedding framework** built upon hypergraph neural networks. CnaHGNN introduces both **bipartite graph** and **hypergraph structures** to capture cross-neighborhood dependencies without significantly increasing topological complexity. Attribute node embeddings from the bipartite graph are aggregated into node embeddings in the hypergraph, and a hypergraph neural network is used to learn **high-order representations**.  

During training, embeddings are refined through an **unsupervised link prediction task**, combined with a **reconstruction function** and an **adaptive dynamic adjustment strategy**, which improves both embedding **quality** and **robustness**.  

Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that CnaHGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its **effectiveness** and **generalizability**.
